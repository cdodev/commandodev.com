Then you start to scale up. You get more revenue, or you take on some funding.
There's more to do, so you add more people. You need to lift your eyes from the
road in front and look to the horizon, so you add **structure** and start making
plans.

Suddenly you can't move as fast as you did before. Your commandos find structure
constrictive and start to leave. A hierarchy begins to form, which slows
**communications** down and introduces noise into the system. The mission becomes
blurry and people aren't sure how what they are doing contributes to the **purpose**
of this grand enterprise that you've put in motion.

There are organisations that have figured out how to move fast, while remaining
oriented on their goals and grounded in who they are. They get the best out of
people in insanely challenging circumstances, often under ludicrous **constraints**.
They operate by consistently holding themselves to standards that are
universally understood and shared. The foundations of this ability are
**operational excellence**, which enables **continuous improvement** and evolution.
