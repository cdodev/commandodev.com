I left the Royal Marines in 2004 and went into **telecoms** operations. The
difference in technology in a modern 3G network compared to what I was working
with in the corps (40 year old analog tech) was stark, and I was also able to
work parts of my embryonic programming skills into my roles. A script to ping
hosts here, a reporting tool there. Finally I was up to the point of making
django web apps by about 2006 which took me to Indonesia and my first foray into
**entrepreneurship**. I also met the **love of my life** and got married!

In 2008 we moved back to the UK and I moved into a career as a full time
programmer. At this point in my life I mostly looked at my time in the Royal
Marines as something that was a great **challenge** and great fun, but as something
separate from my new career.
