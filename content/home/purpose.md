What is your company's reason for being? What's its purpose? What's the one
mission that gets your people fired up for work in the morning?

It's critical that there's a consistent, concise message, which is shared across
the whole organisation, laying out why you're here. A company's mission is the
**WHY** that gets people pulling in the same direction.

Imagine a bunch of iron filings scattered onto a plate. Their orientation is
random there's no discernable pattern. As soon as you bring a magnet within
range though, the filings line up with an invisible force and organise
themselves to point the right direction. **MISSON** is magnetism for people.

“Every person in your company is a vector. Your progress is determined by the
sum of all vectors.”
