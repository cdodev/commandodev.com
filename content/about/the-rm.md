Between deciding I would join the Marines and actually doing it were A-level, 2
years of University engineering (a course I dropped out of), and many of the jobs
I listed above. I didn't actually join until I was just shy of my 23rd birthday
putting me towards the older end of the intake (although thankfully not as old
as "grandad" the ancient 25 year old).

Commando training was a monumental challenge, as it's designed to be. I remain
incredibly proud of earning my green beret, but it was really the lessons I
learned about communicating with people (mainly taught through the medium of
doing it incredibly poorly) that I feel were the most important benefit from
that extremely intense period of my life. After I completed commando training in
December 2000 I went on to do signals training. The kit we were using was about
40 years old by then: in early 2001 we were still using analog radios and
batteries that weighed as much as a small house!

I went on to do operational tours of Sierra Leone shortly after a brutal civil
war, the bandit country of South Armagh in the closing years of the troubles in
Northern Ireland, and finally Op Telic 1: the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
