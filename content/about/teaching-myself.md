When Iraq kicked off I was already thinking about moving on from the corps. The
Royal Marines is a special kind of unit with its own ethos, but ultimately, like
almost all military units, it's a very rigid and hierarchical that you either
fit into or you don't. I decided that I wasn't going to make it a career until I
had a pension, and I was also sceptical that the way the war against terror was
going was the right course so was faced with the conclusion that I should start
thinking about what comes next.

In 2003 I was in my second unit: Commando Helicopter Force, and the way you get
helicopters to a war is on board a ship. So in early 2003 we set sail from
Plymouth, bound for the middle east.
