Fast forward a few years, having gone through a few programming languages to
settle on **Haskell** and a few jobs in finance and start ups and I started to
realise that the experiences I was exposed to in the Royal Marines were
absolutely foundational to understanding performance and how people work
together. I have always been an avid reader and as my technical skills matured I
started to refocus on my fascination with **leadership** and people. Eventually I
read and experienced enough to start making connections between different
fields. I began to see commonalities across learning and leadership in the
forces and technical projects. I began to see how lessons from my martial arts
practice apply to learning a new programming language or operational skill.

There's a concept from Japanese zen which captures this process perfectly.
**Ens≈ç** symbolises enlightenment and the void, which I think is fitting. Often
when you have an intellectual or spiritual breakthrough you realise that you
haven't got somewhere new, but that you have returned to the beginning with a
mindset for new understanding
