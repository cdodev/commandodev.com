In 2003 the unit I was part of, Commando Helicopter Force, was tasked with
supporting the invasion of **Iraq**. We were embarked aboard HMS Ocean, and in early
2003 we set sail from Plymouth, bound for the middle east.

There was a lot of time on board ship and I had a shiny new laptop with me that
a friend had convinced me to put **Linux** on. In the process of installing Red Hat
(and bricking the laptop) I had come across the seminal [How to Become a Hacker](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)
faq by Eric S Raymond, so after we got underway I begged some internet access in
the ships communications centre and bought a book on **python** from amazon. Over
the next few weeks in my down time below desks, with no internet access I banged
my head against it until I had roughly figured out how to write a computer
program.
