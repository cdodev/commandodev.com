My father is an engineer and we spent much of my early childhood in Africa
(Malawi and Lesotho) and the Caribbean (Jamaica). While these experiences were
undoubtedly foundational in shaping the person I've become, to 9 year old me
moving back to a small Essex town with a broad Jamaican accent, this didn't
really seem to be the case.

Having grown up in so many different cultures meant that fitting back into a
homogeneous environment was a bit of a challenge and strengthened my naturally
introspective nature. Being somewhat isolated during my school years did however
strengthen my intense curiosity. It also served to direct that curiosity away
from just figuring out physical objects (I loved to pull things apart and put
them back together) and towards trying to figure out people. This obsession has
lasted ever since.

Like many people of my generation, bullying was a feature of growing up. I'm
sure that was a major driver that lead me at about 13 or 14 to decide that I
would one day join the Royal Marine Commandos. This to my young eyes epitomised
toughness and fitting in to a close nit social structure that had eluded me at
school.
