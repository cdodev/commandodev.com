You know that feeling of spinning your wheels, that you just can't find
**traction**? I've been there. I've experienced this in companies large and small,
new and established. As both a programmer and a technical leader. About 4 years
ago my brain basically short circuited itself and banned me from learning more
tech stuff until I figured people out. I found **answers** in the fields of
cognitive physiology, behavioural economics and in the hundreds of book I read.
Lots of answers in fact, but also a nagging feeling that I was missing something
fundamental - feeling different parts of the elephant without seeing the whole
picture if you will. The most surprising thing about this process of self
education was just how many of the answers were actually reminders.

They were things I had already learned but not recognised when I was a **Royal
Marine** in the early 2000s.

As I learned and read more, many threads in the answers I had found started to
coalesce. The disparate lessons started to merge into **principles**. As I began
to apply these principles to other parts of my life, like my **martial arts**
practice, it also became clear that I'd been looking at many parts of the same
puzzle. There was actually **ONE PRINCIPLE** at the centre of many human
endeavours.

Before I make such a bold claim, let's just take a quick look at the definition
of principle
