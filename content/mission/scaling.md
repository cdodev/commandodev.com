Then you start to scale up. You get more revenue, or you take on some funding.
There's more to do, so you add more people. You need to lift your eyes from the
road in front and look to the horizon, so you add structure and start making
plans.

Suddenly you can't move as fast as you did before. Your commandos find structure
constrictive and start to leave. A hierarchy begins to form, which slows
communications down and introduces noise into the system. The mission becomes
blurry and people aren't sure how what they are doing contributes to the purpose
of this grand enterprise that you've put in motion.
