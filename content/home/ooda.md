It's the **OODA loop**.

The OODA loop is the unifying theory of competition from the mind of **Col. John
Boyd**. It's short for **Observe** **Orient** **Decide** **Act** and understanding this
process is critical to understanding how organisms and organisations relate to
and thrive within their environments.

Col. Boyd was a USAF officer who, despite his relatively lowly rank, cut an
absolute swathe through US defence policy in the late 20th century. Not content
with completely reshaping how airforces comprehend air to air combat and
manoeuvrability in the 50s and 60s, Boyd spent the next 4 decades re-writing the
book on military **strategy and tactics**. He was even instrumental in the design of
the campaign that smashed the Iraqi army and led to the liberation of Kuwait in
first Gulf war of the early 90s.

What came out of this period was a complete rethink on the laws and structure of
conflict, condensed down to a tiny amount of published output. What Boyd was able
to do was take several millennia of learning, from **The Art of War** to the
**Blitzkrieg**, and refine it down to a briefing and a couple of published papers.
Boyd's particular gift lay in combining knowledge from different fields of
endeavour into new conceptual frameworks. So his work on the OODA loop has
proven to be very applicable to domains outside of combat in the intervening
years.

It makes sense when you think about it. Conflict is a crucible that's been
running for thousands of years. Almost like **forced evolution** - the fittest
survive and the weakest do not. What works is refined again and again and what
doesn't work is stripped away over time. Boyd's work on the OODA loop, and some
of his other contributions, take the output from that crucible and extract the
**essential structure** that make it all work. Small wonder then that this is a theory
that can be applied to pretty much everything.
