My father is an engineer and we spent much of my early childhood in Africa
(Malawi and Lesotho) and the Caribbean (Jamaica). While these experiences were
undoubtedly foundational in shaping the person I've become, to 9 year old me
moving back to a small Essex town with a broad Jamaican accent, this didn't
really seem to be the case.

As a child I struggled to fit in, with the benefit of hindsight I've put this
down to about 50% personality and the rest due to moving around and not really
forming stable friendship groups. It's tough to be a kid who doesn't have many
friends, and even tougher to be the kid who ends up as one of the class victims
as I did at senior school. However being somewhat isolated did strengthen my
intense curiosity. It also served to direct that curiosity away from just
figuring out physical objects (I loved to pull things apart and put them back
together) and towards trying to figure out people. This obsession has lasted
ever since.

Partly I'm sure due to the bullying I suffered, when I was about 13 or 14 I
decided that I would one day join the Royal Marine Commandos. This to my young
eyes epitomised toughness and fitting in to a close nit social structure that
had eluded me at school. This didn't happen as soon as it could though
(procrastination turned out to be a strong component of my character sitting
beside curiosity).
