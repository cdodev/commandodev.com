There are organisations that have figured out how to move fast, while remaining
oriented on their goals and grounded in who they are. They get the best out of
people in insanely challenging circumstances, often under ludicrous constraints.
They operate by consistently holding themselves to standards that are
universally understood and shared.

One such organisation which has been learning an honing these lessons for over
350 years is the Royal Marines.

All elite military units have high performance figured out. They are able to
mould recruits into exceptional soldiers who can be part of a complex social
structure in a matter of months. The Royal Marines have evolved from a regiment
of maritime foot soldiers formed in 1664 through many evolutions to today's role
as an elite, commando trained, rapid reaction force.
