Goal:

_Survive, survive on own terms, or improve our capacity for independent action._

The competition for limited resources to satisfy these desires may force one to:

_Diminish adversaryâ€™s capacity for independent action, or deny him the opportunity to survive on his terms, or make it impossible for him to survive at all._
