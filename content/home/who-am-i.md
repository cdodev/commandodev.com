You know that feeling of spinning your wheels, that you just can't find
**traction**? I've been there. Over my decade plus career in software
development, I've experienced this in many of the companies I've worked for.
This includes everything from start ups where I was the first programmer on
board, to building teams in global mega banks.

About 4 years ago my brain basically short circuited itself and banned me from
learning more tech stuff until I figured people and teams out.

I found many **answers** in the fields of cognitive physiology, behavioural
economics and in the hundreds of book I read, but I couldn't help feeling that I
was missing something fundamental - feeling different parts of the elephant
without seeing the whole picture. The most surprising thing about this process
of self education was just how many of the answers were actually reminders of my
career before technology and programming.

They were things I had already learned, and in fact deeply ingrained but not
recognised when I was a **Royal Marine** in the early 2000s.

Having this moment of recognition was a breakthrough, because it showed me that
once you are able to translate something from one domain to another and keep the
essence of why it works, you have your hands on a fundamental principle. This is
nothing new. The famous swordsman Musashi knew this way back in the 1600s:

"The principle of strategy is having one thing, to know ten thousand things"

{{% /blockquote %}}

The disparate lessons started to merge into **principles**. As I began to apply
these principles to other parts of my life, like my **martial arts** practice, it
also became clear that I'd been looking at many parts of the same puzzle. There
was actually **ONE PRINCIPLE** at the centre of many human endeavours.

Before I make such a bold claim, let's just take a quick look at the definition
of principle
