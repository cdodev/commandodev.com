My mission is to teach growing tech based companies how to achieve and maintain
operational excellence as they scale

** The problem
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: the-problem
:END:
Starting something is hard. You sweat, struggle and persist and you're off and
running, you start to gain momentum. You build a team around you of dedicated
*commandos* - the ones who take risks, get shit done and make things happen - the
starters. The company is small, communications overhead is minimal and you're
focused on becoming sustainable and proving your viability.

But then what?
** Scaling
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: scaling
:END:

Then you start to scale up. You get more revenue, or you take on some funding.
There's more to do, so you add more people. You need to lift your eyes from the
road in front and look to the horizon, so you add structure and start making
plans.

Suddenly you can't move as fast as you did before. Your commandos find structure
constrictive and start to leave. A hierarchy begins to form, which slows
communications down and introduces noise into the system. The mission becomes
blurry and people aren't sure how what they are doing contributes to the purpose
of this grand enterprise that you've put in motion.

** Performing
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: performing
:END:

There are organisations that have figured out how to move fast, while remaining
oriented on their goals and grounded in who they are. They get the best out of
people in insanely challenging circumstances, often under ludicrous constraints.
They operate by consistently holding themselves to standards that are
universally understood and shared.

One such organisation which has been learning an honing these lessons for over
350 years is the Royal Marines.

All elite military units have high performance figured out. They are able to
mould recruits into exceptional soldiers who can be part of a complex social
structure in a matter of months. The Royal Marines have evolved from a regiment
of maritime foot soldiers formed in 1664 through many evolutions to today's role
as an elite, commando trained, rapid reaction force.

I learned to code on a warship in 2003 on the way to Iraq. I've been a commando,
a bouncer, a barman, a refuse collector (for one day), an itinerant marquee
fabricator, a telecoms engineer and a programmer.

** My Story
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: my-story
:END:
My father is an engineer and we spent much of my early childhood in Africa
(Malawi and Lesotho) and the Caribbean (Jamaica). While these experiences were
undoubtedly foundational in shaping the person I've become, to 9 year old me
moving back to a small Essex town with a broad Jamaican accent, this didn't
really seem to be the case.

Having grown up in so many different cultures meant that fitting back into a
homogeneous environment was a bit of a challenge and strengthened my naturally
introspective nature. Being somewhat isolated during my school years did however
strengthen my intense curiosity. It also served to direct that curiosity away
from just figuring out physical objects (I loved to pull things apart and put
them back together) and towards trying to figure out people. This obsession has
lasted ever since.

Like many people of my generation, bullying was a feature of growing up. I'm
sure that was a major driver that lead me at about 13 or 14 to decide that I
would one day join the Royal Marine Commandos. This to my young eyes epitomised
toughness and fitting in to a close nit social structure that had eluded me at
school.
** The Royal Marines
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: the-rm
:END:

Having decided on the Royal Marines in my teens, I didn't actually end up
joining until I was just shy of my 23rd birthday. This put me towards the older
end of the intake (although thankfully not as old as "grandad" the ancient 25
year old).

Commando training was a monumental challenge, as it's designed to be. I remain
incredibly proud of earning my green beret, but it was really the lessons I
learned about communicating with people (mainly taught through the medium of
doing it incredibly poorly) that I feel were the most important benefit from
that extremely intense period of my life.

During my 4 years in the corps I completed operational tours of Sierra Leone
shortly after the brutal civil war, the bandit country of South Armagh in the
closing years of the troubles in Northern Ireland, and finally Op Telic 1: the
second gulf war in 2003.

The Royal Marines is a special kind of unit with its own ethos, but ultimately,
like almost all military units, it's a very rigid and hierarchical. You either
fit into that structure or you don't. I decided that I wasn't going to make it a
career until I had a pension, and I was also sceptical that the way the war
against terror was escalating was the right course so in about 2003 I began
thinking about what would come next.

** Teaching myself programming
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: teaching-myself
:END:

In 2003 the unit I was part of, Commando Helicopter Force, was tasked with
supporting the invasion of Iraq. We were embarked aboard HMS Ocean, and in early
2003 we set sail from Plymouth, bound for the middle east.

There was a lot of time on board ship and I had a shiny new laptop with me that
a friend had convinced me to put Linux on. In the process of installing Red Hat
(and bricking the laptop) I had come across the seminal [[http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html][How to Become a Hacker]]
faq by Eric S Raymond, so after we got underway I begged some internet access in
the ships communications centre and bought a book on python from amazon. Over
the next few weeks in my down time below desks, with no internet access I banged
my head against it until I had roughly figured out how to write a computer
program.

** Progression
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: progression
:END:

I left the Royal Marines in 2004 and went into telecoms operations. The
difference in technology in a modern 3G network compared to what I was working
with in the corps (40 year old analog tech) was stark, and I was also able to
work parts of my embryonic programming skills into my roles. A script to ping
hosts here, a reporting tool there. Finally I was up to the point of making
django web apps by about 2006 which took me to Indonesia and my first foray into
entrepreneurship. I also met the love of my life and got married!

In 2008 we moved back to the UK and I moved into a career as a full time
programmer. At this point in my life I mostly looked at my time in the Royal
Marines as something that was a great challenge and great fun, but as something
separate from my new career. I was wrong.

** Full circle

Fast forward a few years, having gone through a few programming languages to
settle on Haskell and a few jobs in finance and start ups and I started to
realise that the experiences I was exposed to in the Royal Marines were
absolutely foundational to understanding performance and how people work
together. I have always been an avid reader and as my technical skills matured I
started to refocus on my fascination with leadership and people. Eventually I
read and experienced enough to start making connections between different
fields. I began to see commonalities across learning and leadership in the
forces and technical projects. I began to see how lessons from my martial arts
practice apply to learning a new programming language or operational skill.

There's a concept from Japanese zen which captures this process perfectly.
*Ens≈ç* symbolises enlightenment and the void, which I think is fitting. Often
when you have an intellectual or spiritual breakthrough you realise that you
haven't got somewhere new, but that you have returned to the beginning with a
mindset for new understanding
