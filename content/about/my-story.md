My father is an engineer and we spent much of my early childhood in Africa
(Malawi and Lesotho) and the Caribbean (Jamaica).

Having grown up in so many different cultures meant that moving back to the UK
and fitting into a homogeneous environment was a bit of a challenge and
strengthened my naturally **introspective** nature. Being somewhat isolated during
my school years did however strengthen my intense **curiosity**. It also served to
direct that curiosity away from just figuring out physical objects (I loved to
pull things apart and put them back together) and towards trying to figure out
people. This obsession has lasted ever since.

Like many people of my generation, **bullying** was a feature of growing up. I'm
sure that was a major driver that lead me at about 13 or 14 to decide that I
would one day join the Royal Marine Commandos. This to my young eyes epitomised
toughness and fitting in to a close-knit social structure that had eluded me at
school.
