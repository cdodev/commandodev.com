Having decided on the Royal Marines in my teens, I didn't actually end up
joining until I was just shy of my 23rd birthday. This put me towards the older
end of the intake (although thankfully not as old as "grandad" the ancient 25
year old).

**Commando training** was a monumental challenge, as it's designed to be. I remain
incredibly proud of earning my **green beret**, but it was really the lessons I
learned about communicating with people (mainly taught through the medium of
doing it incredibly poorly) that I feel were the most important benefit from
that extremely intense period of my life.

During my 4 years in the corps I completed operational tours of **Sierra Leone**
shortly after the brutal civil war, the bandit country of **South Armagh** in the
closing years of the troubles in Northern Ireland, and finally **Op Telic 1: the
second gulf war** in 2003.

The Royal Marines is a special kind of unit with its own ethos, but ultimately,
like almost all military units, it's a very rigid and hierarchical. You either
fit into that **structure** or you don't. I decided that I wasn't going to make it a
career until I had a pension, and I was also sceptical that the way the war
against terror was escalating was the right course so in about 2003 I began
thinking about what would come next.
