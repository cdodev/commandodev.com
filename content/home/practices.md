When you know you do something well, when you've really nailed it, is it
repeatable? Can you teach anyone to achieve the same level of **excellence** you
have reached?

**Process** can be a bit of a dirty word in software development. It conjures up
images of big A agile consultants enforcing rituals and ceremonies that
ultimately do nothing to improve performance and everything to destroy morale.
Most professional developers will have at least one horror story of working in a
place that fell for this kind of cargo culting.

That's why I prefer to think in terms of **PRACTICES**

Practices are your playbooks. In the Royal Marines we would refer to these as
**SOPs**: Standard Operating Procedures. They are constantly evolving, improving
instructions that point the way to ever increasing performance.
