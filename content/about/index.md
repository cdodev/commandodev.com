I learned to code on a warship in 2003 on the way to Iraq. I've been a commando,
a bouncer, a barman, a refuse collector (for one day), an itinerant marquee
fabricator, a telecoms engineer and a programmer.

Throughout all those experiences, I've also always remained a dedicated student
of the human condition. How we interact with and process the experiences we have
completely fascinates me.
