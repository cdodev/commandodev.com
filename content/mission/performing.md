There are organisations that have figured out how to move fast, while remaining
oriented on their goals and grounded in who they are. They get the best out of
people in insanely challenging circumstances, often under ludicrous **constraints**.
They operate by consistently holding themselves to standards that are
universally understood and shared. The foundations of this ability are
**operational excellence**, which enables **continuous improvement** and evolution.

One such organisation which has been learning an honing these lessons for over
350 years is the **Royal Marines**. Way before I was a software developer I served
in the corps, in fact I [taught myself how to code](/about/) en route to the second Iraq
war on board a ship. When I began my second career in software development I
looked up my time in the corps as something fun and challenging that had
certainly shaped me personally, but that didn't have much bearing on my new
direction.

**I was wrong.**

The Royal Marines have evolved from a regiment of maritime foot soldiers formed
in 1664 through constant evolution to today's role as an elite, commando trained,
rapid reaction force. They have **high performance** figured out, and can teach it
with a repeatable process that's been forged in the fire of **consistent improvement**
since the time we've had armies.

When I started to realise just what fundamental lessons I'd been exposed to in
the corps I spent all my spare time working out how to distil those lessons down
to the **fundamental principles** which could be used in any domain. While the
principles are universal - the implementation of teaching them in the corps
involves lots of cold water and certainly wouldn't suit everyone.
