Have you built an MVP, followed the lean start up way and achieved product
market fit? Are you now at the point where you are going to start scaling your
business, adding more people and accelerating the execution of your mission?

{{% emphasis %}}What's your strategy?{{% /emphasis %}}

The behaviours and tactics that worked to get you out of the blocks and running
are not the same as those required to achieve and maintain scaleable growth.
Getting this transition right is incredibly important: do it too early and
you'll stifle your ability to iterate with a small team. Do it too late, or not
at all, and you'll be trying to layer more people into a chaotic environment and
you'll kill their ability to deliver.

I've been in many of these situations over the last 10 years in tech. An
organisation scaling up without putting the right systems in place is a horrible
place to be. No matter how strong the founder's vision and how compelling the
mission, without the **right foundations** the company lurches from one crisis to
another and can't deliver. It's a stressful, frustrating experience that drives
the best people out of the company.

Before I had a career in tech I was a **Royal Marine Commando**, and it's there that
I learned the essence of building a high performance culture. What I do now for
my customers is to translate the operational excellence that's driven the corps'
evolution for the last 3 and a half centuries to a set of systems for tech
businesses.

It's all based on a **single abstraction**. Understanding this one thing is what
allows you to understand the **10,000 things** that are required for elite
performance and continuous improvement in the face of change.
