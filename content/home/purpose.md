What is your company's reason for being? What's its purpose? What's the one
mission that gets your people fired up for work in the morning?

It's critical that there's a consistent, concise message, which is shared across the
whole organisation, laying out who you are and why you're here. A company's
mission is the glue that binds people together and gets them pulling in the same
direction.

Imagine a bunch of iron filings scattered onto a plate. Their orientation is
random there's no discernable pattern. As soon as you bring a magnet within
range though, the filings line up with an invisible force and organise
themselves to point the right direction. **Mission** is magnetism for people.

“Every person in your company is a vector. Your progress is determined by the
sum of all vectors.”
