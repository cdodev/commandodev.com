Having this moment of recognition was a breakthrough, because it showed me that
once you are able to translate something from one domain to another and keep the
essence of why it works, you have your hands on a fundamental principle. This is
nothing new. The famous swordsman Musashi knew this way back in the 1600s:

The disparate lessons started to merge into **principles**. As I began to apply
these principles to other parts of my life, like my **martial arts** practice, it
also became clear that I'd been looking at many parts of the same puzzle. There
was actually **ONE PRINCIPLE** at the centre of many human endeavours.

The single principle that's you must understand to achieve the **operational
excellence** that every business needs to **thrive** and **scale**.

The single principle that unites the 3 pillars of **PURPOSE** **PEOPLE** and **PRACTICES**
