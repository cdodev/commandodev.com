One such organisation which has been learning and honing these lessons for over
350 years is the **Royal Marines**. Way before I was a software developer I served
in the corps, in fact I [taught myself how to code](/about/) en route to the second Iraq
war on board a ship. When I began my second career in software development I
looked up my time in the corps as something fun and challenging that had
certainly shaped me personally, but that didn't have much bearing on my new
direction.
